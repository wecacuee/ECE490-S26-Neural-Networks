## Script

### Introduction (1 min)

Hello and welcome to ECE 490/590: Neural Networks!

[VISUAL: Course title slide with neural network animation]

I'm Dr. Vikas Dhiman, and I'll be your instructor for this course. I'm excited to guide you through one of the most transformative technologies of our time.

By the end of this course, you'll understand how neural networks work from the ground up - not just how to use them, but how to build them yourself.

### Section 1: What is a Neural Network? (2.5 min)

[VISUAL: Biological neuron diagram]

Let's start with a fundamental question: What is a neural network?

The name comes from biology. This is a biological neuron - a cell in your brain. It has:
- **Dendrites** that receive signals from other neurons
- A **cell body** that processes those signals
- An **axon** that sends output to other neurons

[VISUAL: Synapse diagram showing signal transmission]

Neurons communicate through **synapses** - connections where electrical and chemical signals pass from one neuron to another. Your brain has about 86 billion neurons with trillions of connections!

[VISUAL: Artificial neuron overlaid on biological neuron]

An **artificial neural network** is inspired by this structure:
- **Inputs** (like dendrites) receive data
- **Weights** (like synaptic strengths) determine importance
- **Activation function** (like the cell body) processes information
- **Output** (like the axon) sends results forward

[VISUAL: Simple neural network diagram]

When we connect many artificial neurons in layers, we get a neural network that can learn patterns from data.

**Key insight:** We're not simulating the brain - we're borrowing its architecture to build powerful learning systems.

### Section 2: Where Neural Networks Fit (2 min)

[VISUAL: AI/ML/DL Venn diagram]

You've probably heard many related terms. Let me clarify:

**Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The broadest term - any system that exhibits intelligent behavior
- Includes rule-based systems, search algorithms, expert systems

**Machine Learning (ML):** A subset of AI where systems learn from data
- Includes decision trees, SVMs, clustering, and neural networks

**Deep Learning:** Neural networks with many layers
- The "deep" refers to the depth of the network

[VISUAL: Timeline showing AI winter and resurgence]

Neural networks have had an interesting history:
- 1950s-60s: Initial excitement (Perceptron)
- 1970s-80s: "AI Winter" - limited progress
- 2012: AlexNet revolution - deep learning takes off
- Today: Foundation of GPT, image recognition, self-driving cars

### Section 3: How This Course Differs (1.5 min)

[VISUAL: Comparison table with other courses]

Let me explain how this course compares to related courses at UMaine:

**ECE 491/591 Deep Learning (Dr. Zhu):**
- More application-focused
- Uses existing libraries
- *We go deeper on the math and implementation*

**COS 475/575 Machine Learning (Dr. Chen):**
- Covers many ML algorithms (SVM, decision trees, etc.)
- Broader but less depth on neural networks
- *We focus exclusively on neural networks*

**COS 470/570 Intro to AI:**
- Covers search, planning, logic
- Neural networks are just one topic
- *We dive deep into neural networks*

[VISUAL: Course focus diagram]

**Our unique approach:**
- Implement automatic differentiation from scratch
- Build your own PyTorch-like library
- Understand theory deeply, not just API calls

### Section 4: Course Goals and Outcomes (2 min)

[VISUAL: Three main goals]

By the end of this course, you will:

**1. Understand Fundamentals**
- How a single neuron computes
- How layers combine into networks
- How backpropagation trains the network

**2. Implement from Scratch**
- Automatic differentiation (forward and reverse mode)
- Build a mini deep learning library
- Implement common architectures (MLPs, CNNs, Transformers)

**3. Apply to Real Problems**
- Image classification
- Text generation
- Your own project!

[VISUAL: Student Learning Outcomes]

**Specific Learning Outcomes:**
- SLO 1: Use open-source neural network software (PyTorch)
- SLO 2: Understand foundations, limitations, and strengths
- SLO 3: Debug and improve neural networks on different problems

[VISUAL: Sample of final project possibilities]

Your final project lets you apply these skills to a problem you care about!

### Section 5: Course Structure and Grading (2 min)

[VISUAL: Course schedule overview]

**Course Structure:**
- Asynchronous online lectures
- Weekly Code Jam sessions (Fridays 3:30-4:30 PM)
- Homeworks every other week
- Two midterm exams
- Final project

[VISUAL: Grading breakdown pie chart]

**Grading (ECE 490):**
| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Exams | 30% |
| Assignments | 35% |
| Project | 35% |
| Class participation | 5% |

**ECE 590 students:** Additional 10% for paper review and presentation (project weight reduced to 25%).

[VISUAL: Grade scale]

**Grade Scale:** 90% (A) / 80% (B) / 70% (C) / 60% (D)

**Important Policies:**
- Late submissions: 10% penalty, one wild-card for emergencies
- No make-ups for missed exams
- Collaboration encouraged for understanding, but write your own solutions

### Section 7: AI Tools Policy (1 min)

[VISUAL: ChatGPT policy summary]

A word about AI tools like ChatGPT:

**Allowed:**
- Looking up documentation
- Understanding concepts
- Generating starter examples (then rewrite yourself)

**Not Allowed:**
- Submitting AI-generated solutions directly
- Completing assignments without understanding

**Why this policy?**
- AI can solve homework but not real problems
- You need to build genuine understanding
- AI makes mistakes - you must be able to verify

**When using external sources:**
- Clearly mark adapted code
- Cite your sources
- Test and verify everything

Title: Python Variable Scope
Points: 1
2. In Python, what determines the scope of a variable?
a) Curly braces {}

c) Semicolons
d) The `var` keyword

Title: Python Integer Type
Points: 1
3. What is the principal built-in numeric type in Python for numbers without a decimal point?
a) float
*b) int
c) decimal
d) number

Title: Floating Point Precision
Points: 1
4. What happens when you add 0.1 + 0.2 in Python and compare it to 0.3 using `==`?
a) Returns True because the values are equal
*b) Returns False due to floating-point representation imprecision
c) Raises a TypeError
d) Returns True only in Python 3

Title: IEEE 754 Format
Points: 1
5. In IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point format, how is a number represented?
a) As a single integer value
*b) As sign, exponent, and fraction components
c) As a string of decimal digits
d) As a ratio of two integers

Title: Empty List Boolean
Points: 1
6. What is the value of `bool([])` in Python?
a) True
*b) False
c) None
d) Raises an error

Title: None Constant
Points: 1
7. What does the `None` constant represent in Python?
a) The number zero
b) An empty string
*c) The absence of a value, similar to nullptr in C
d) A boolean False value

Title: F-String Syntax
Points: 1
8. Which of the following correctly creates an f-string in Python?
a) "Hello {name}"
*b) f"Hello {name}"
c) format("Hello {name}")
d) str("Hello {name}")

Title: List Slicing
Points: 1
9. Given `my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, what does `my_list[1:4]` return?
a) [1, 2, 3, 4]
*b) [2, 3, 4]
c) [1, 2, 3]
d) [2, 3, 4, 5]

Title: sorted vs sort
Points: 1
10. What is the difference between `sorted(colors)` and `colors.sort()`?
*a) `sorted()` returns a new list without modifying the original; `sort()` modifies the original list in place
b) `sorted()` modifies the original list; `sort()` returns a new list
c) They are identical in behavior
d) `sorted()` only works with strings; `sort()` works with any type

Title: Negative Indexing
Points: 1
11. What does `my_list[-1]` return for `my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]`?
a) 10
b) An error
c) -1
*d) 40

Title: Jupyter Bash Command
Points: 1
12. Which command in a Jupyter notebook executes a bash command?
*a) !command
b) %command
c) $command
d) @command

Title: Float Type
Points: 1
13. What is the output of `type(3.14)`?
a) `<class 'int'>`
*b) `<class 'float'>`
c) `<class 'decimal'>`
d) `<class 'number'>`

Title: Set Properties
Points: 1
14. In Python, which data structure is mutable and ensures uniqueness of elements?
a) tuple
b) list
*c) set
d) string

Title: Step Slicing
Points: 1
15. What does the slice notation `my_list[::2]` do?
a) Returns every element starting from index 2
*b) Returns every other element (step of 2)
c) Returns the first 2 elements
d) Returns the last 2 elements

Title: List Implementation
Points: 1
16. Which statement about Python lists is correct?
a) Python lists are implemented as linked lists
*b) Python lists are implemented as dynamic arrays
c) Python lists have a fixed size
d) Python lists can only contain elements of the same type

Title: Main Guard
Points: 1
17. What is the purpose of `if __name__ == '__main__':` in Python?
a) To define the main function
*b) To execute code only when the file is run directly, not when imported
c) To declare the entry point for C-style compilation
d) To create a private namespace

Title: Memory Management
Points: 1
18. What does Python use for memory management?
a) Manual malloc/free calls
b) Stack-based allocation only
*c) Reference counting and garbage collection
